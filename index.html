            <h3>Where I Grew Up</h3>

            <p>In the southern part of Missouri, across from Illinois, there is a town called Cape Girardeau. With a population of roughly 40,000, the town was a melting pot where there was an opportunity to meet many different people. Cape Girardeau was known for the bridge connecting it to Illinois, the flood walls with various historical paintings on it, and scenes from the movie "Gone Girl" being filmed there.</p>

            <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
            <img src="images\i419466-1119078357748663647.jpg" alt="ISpeakSax">
            <p>Over the years there's been a lot of opportunities for learning new skills. Art, specifically pencil sketching, encited a passion for all things creativity. After that it was a dive into music which, as a child, was immediately despised. Later in life, music actually became the best skill to have learned. More skills included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Music recording and production</li>
                <li>Photo editing and minipulation in Adobe Photoshop</li>
                <li>Video editing in Adobe Premiere</li>
                <li>Orthodontic appliance fabrication</li>
                <li>Digital alignment of teeth (CAD/CAM)</li>
                <li>Web Development</li>

            <h3>Plans for the Future</h3>
            <img src="images\coding-825x500.jpg" alt="Coding">
            <p>Looking forward, working towards being a developer is the current goal. Landing a job as a developer would increase both a feeling of achievement and finances. It's a tough journey, but a journey worth it nonetheless. Afterwards, there will be a continuation of learning more in terms of development as well as other skills.</p>
